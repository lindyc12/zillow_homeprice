A home is often the most expensive purchase a person makes. Ensuring homeowners have a trusted way to monitor this asset is important. For this project the goal will be testing out different features to see what can help predict home value better. The features i will used come from a a dataset that i cleaned and split into train, validate and test. I will be using Regression models and use Root means square error as an evaluation metric.

Workflow:
-Import Libraries 
-Exploratory Data Analysis
-Data cleaning 
-Data splitting
-Baseline model training
-Feature engineering n
-Robust model Training and Hyperparameter tuning
-Conclusion & Future Work


What features have correlation? 
Does SqFt affect home value?

To reproduce you will need:
     An env.py file that contains the host, username and password for the mySQL database and go into the Zillow table. Store that env file in the same repository. Clone my repository along with the acquire.py and prepare.py. Make sure .gitignore is hiding your env.py. You should be able to run survival_report.
Libraries used:
    pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn, scipy, 


Next steps:
    Try to improve prediction result by applying others Features selection.
